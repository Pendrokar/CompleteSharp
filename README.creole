Changes from the original completesharp project
 * Recognises csx files
 * Settings (completesharp_assemblies) configured to search your packages directory. ***Note*** This only works if you open a folder or use a sublime project. Packages folder assumed to be in the same directory as your scripts. i.e.
{{{
    \folder    (to open in submlime)
        myscript.csx
            \packages
                Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core.4.0.XXX
                Microsoft.AspNet......
}}}


== Installation ==
    * If you want to manually install it using git instead:
    ** Go to your packages directory and type:
    ***        git clone --recursive https://github.com/ewilde/CompleteSharp
    ** To update to the latest commit, use this command in the CompleteSharp directory:
    ***        git pull && git submodule foreach --recursive git pull origin master
    * Once installed, you probably want to tweak the "completesharp_assemblies" setting, specifying the full path to extra assemblies to load


== Plugin is being rewritten ==
** I(quarnster) don't intend to continue development of this plugin, so I've disabled the issues page. If something is broken, submit a pull request and I'll consider merging it.

** Eventually it will be replaced by https://github.com/quarnster/completion. If you'd like to see that move along quicker, submit a pull request and/or participate in its discussions.
